Unfortunately, due to the severity of my injury I still required surgery. After surgery, I returned for physical therapy and dry needling treatments. Interestingly enough, a close friend of mine had a similar surgery four months earlier. Her post surgery therapy plan did not involve dry needling but rather more traditional therapeutic techniques",

This approach is essential in the early stages of rehabilitation when the patient has limited mobility or reduced muscle strength.  In active rehabilitation therapy, the patient initiates the movement, and the robot helps only when necessary. This method stimulates neuroplasticity and encourages the relearning of motor skills through active practice.  Bilateral rehabilitation therapy involves the simultaneous use of both limbs, where the activity of a healthy limb is mirrored or assisted by the robot on the affected limb",
