ðŸ§© What Is package.json?
A package.json file is the manifest for any Node.js project, specifying things like:

the projectâ€™s metadata (name, version)

its JavaScript dependencies

scripts for running, building, and testing
These allow npm install, npm start, or yarn build to work predictably.â€¯

In React apps (or any frontend built with Node tools), package.json defines what dependencies the UI needsâ€”like React, React Router, Elm, CSS toolchains, types, etc.â€¯

ðŸ—‚ Why Two package.json Files?
When you split your app into a backend (Python) folder and a frontend (React) folder, each part is a separate Node/JS or Python project:

frontend/package.json

Lives in the frontend/ directory

Keeps all your React UI dependencies and scripts (like "start", "build", "test")â€¯

You run npm install and npm start inside this folder only

root/backend (or project root)

Uses Python tooling only (e.g. pyproject.toml, requirements.txt)

No package.json is needed here unless you want a full-stack monorepo with shared tools

This separation makes your workflow cleaner and follows common practice to keep frontend and backend independent and reusable.â€¯
